 *
 * $breakup-breakpoints: List of many named breakpoints that can be called with
 *     breakup-breakpoint. Each breakpoint is a list containing the breakpoint
 *     name and the media query it describes. Example:
 *
 *     $breakup-breakpoints: (
 *       'palm' '(max-width: 480px)',
 *       'lap' '(min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 1023px)',
 *       'portable' '(max-width: 1023px)',
 *       'desk' '(min-width: 1024px)'
 *     );
 *
 *
 * $breakup-included-blocks: A list of blocks to render in your stylesheet
 *
 *
 * $breakup-naked: Should breakpoint/tweakpoint blocks be wrapped in an @media
 *     declaration? You should set this to true within stylesheets for browsers
 *     which don't support @media, such as oldIE.
 *
 *
 * $breakup-allow-naked: List of named breakpoints and if they should be output
 *     when $breakup-naked is true (by default this is false). This is separate
 *     to $breakup-breakpoints because you may want to configure what
 *     breakpoints are unwrapped on a per stylesheet basis.
