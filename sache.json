  "name": "Breakup",
  "description": "Breakup is a Sass component that allows you to create multiple CSS files from a single Sass partial by wrapping your code within breakpoint blocks. It allows you to abstract what your Sass partials folder looks like from what CSS files you create. Because of this you can easily create per-breakpoint CSS files (e.g. base, mobile, tablet and desktop) and fallback files where no styles are wrapped (e.g. for oldIE which does not support media queries).",
